## 1. Titanic Death Prediction Project

This project utilizes the Titanic dataset to predict survival outcomes for passengers based on various features. Leveraging machine learning algorithms, including decision trees and logistic regression, we aim to analyze historical data and predict survival probabilities accurately.

### Dataset Overview
The Titanic dataset contains information about passengers, including their age, gender, ticket class, and whether they survived the disaster. It serves as a classic example in the field of data science for binary classification tasks.

### Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the dataset, handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Extract relevant features and engineer new ones to improve model performance.
3. **Model Training:** Train machine learning models such as decision trees and logistic regression using the preprocessed data.
4. **Evaluation:** Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. **Prediction:** Make predictions on unseen data to determine survival probabilities for passengers.

### Results
The trained models achieve promising performance on the validation set, with accuracy exceeding 80%. Further analysis and optimization are ongoing to enhance predictive accuracy and generalize the model.

### How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies specified in `requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook `Titanic_Death_Prediction.ipynb` to explore the dataset, preprocess data, train models, and make predictions.
